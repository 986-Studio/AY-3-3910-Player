Now the formal things are done.

The small project is to provide a simple and easy way to play YM
files on a computer using the less possible component.

It is currently only using a resistor, a AY-3-3910 (but any version
is fine for playing music), a femal audio jack connector to let plug
something to ear the nice sound, an Arduino and a buch of wire,
nothing more.

Most project I saw before was using a quartz to provide a clock to
the AY, but this is just useless and expensive when you have a ÂµC
with timers :)

As the Arduino does not have enought memory to store teh YM file,
it is somewhat streamed from the PC trought the USB cable.

A Fritzing schematic is not ready yet but will come ASAP.

This project may evolve in a fully autonoous Arduino capable of playing
YM/MYM file without the need of a PC streaming. I may use the
Gameduino2 for it's the display and SD part.

I've included a simple MYM file with this project: Thrust.mym
It's the Title music of the game Thrust on the Atari ST, music
composed by Rob Hubbard.

To convert ym to mym I recommend the ym2mym tool that come with the
OSDK (Oric SDK) that can be found here: http://osdk.defence-force.org

Enjoy!
