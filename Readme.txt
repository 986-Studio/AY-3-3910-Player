Now the formal things are done.

This small project is to provide a simple and easy way to play YM
files on a computer using the less possible component.

It is currently only using a resistor, a AY-3-3910 (but any version
is fine for playing music), a femal audio jack connector to let you
ear the nice sound, an Arduino, a buch of wire, and nothing more.

Most project I saw before was using a quartz to provide a clock to
the AY, but this is just useless and expensive when you have a ÂµC
with timers :)

As the Arduino does not have enought memory to store the YM file,
it is stream from the PC trought the USB virtual serial port.

You can find a Fritzing schematic in the file 
project-ay-3-3910-breadboard.png

This project may evolve in a fully autonomous Arduino capable of
playing YM/MYM file without the need of a PC. I may use the
Gameduino2 for its display and SD connector.

*********************************************************************

I've included a simple MYM file with this project: Thrust.mym
It's the Title music of the game Thrust on the Atari ST, music
composed by Rob Hubbard.

To convert ym to mym I recommend the ym2mym tool that come with the
OSDK (Oric SDK) that can be found here: http://osdk.defence-force.org

Enjoy!
